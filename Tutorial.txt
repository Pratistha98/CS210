Recommended: 
If you have a Windows computer (like me lol), it's way easier to use git bash which is just a better version of the Windows terminal. You can find it and install it from here: https://gitforwindows.org/. It's perfectly fine to keep using your terminal though! 

Basics:
Before you start working on pushing you changes, make sure to pull any changes that may have recently been made!
$ git pull
$ git add . 
$ git commit -m "commit message: concise description of changes made"
$ git push origin master

Branches:
You made a change in the code and want to push changes to the repository for the team to see. 
Typically, the changes you make should be made in 'branches' so it doesn't interfere with code that other people may have worked on and pushed to the repository.

$ git checkout -b branch-name
$ git add . 
$ git commit -m "commit message: concise description of changes made"
$ git push origin branch-name

You can view all branches by using 
$ git branch -a

You can check activity on the repository by typing
$ git status

Let me know if you run into problems! <3
